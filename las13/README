This is the las13 library.

Contents:
	las13reader: C++ library for reading a LAS1.3 file
	swig: swig scripts for wrapping the las13reader into a python library
	las13.py: a simplified user friendly interface for the swigged library.

NOTE: You need all of these to have a working version. These have only been built on Fedora 19 distributions.


INSTALL
-------

1. To build the C++ library. Go into the las13reader directory. Then should be as simple as just running make.
2. To build the swig python library. Go into the swig directory. Then should be as simple as just running make.

Then you need to make sure everything is installed in the correct places.
e.g. for python make sure that the following files are in your python path:
 swig/las13reader.py 
 swig/_las13reader.so
 las13.py

e.g. for c++ make sure that the following files are available for include:
 las13reader/src/Las1_3_handler.h
 las13reader/src/PulseManager.h
 las13reader/src/Pulse.h

and that the library is available for both compile and runtime (either move it or export it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH):
 las13reader/liblas13reader.so
